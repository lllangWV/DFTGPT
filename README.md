# DFTGPT Research Project

Welcome to the DFTGPT research project! In this project, we will be exploring the applications of Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the GPT language model.

## Storing PDF Documents

To store your PDF documents, please create a directory named `data/dft_papers` in the root of this project. Place all your PDF files in this directory for easy access and organization.

## Setting up API Key

In order to use the OpenAI API for language processing, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root of this project. Inside the `.env` file, store your OpenAI API key using the following format: `OPENAI_API_KEY : {key}`
